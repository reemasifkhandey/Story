Once upon a time in a forest, there lived a monkey on a berry tree, which was on the banks of a river. In the same forest,
there lived a crocodile and his wife.......
One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under a tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them.
As days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
One day, the same monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile's wife.
She ate the fruits and liked them but was jealous, as she did not like her husband spending time with the monkey.
